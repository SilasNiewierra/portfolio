  headline: About PrettyMe
  content: PrettyMe has a very simple concept. Two pictures, one winner. With a quick
    swipe you decide who is more handsome. By winning matches, you gain points. Once
    you reach a certain amount of points, you get a new crown which indicates different
    levels. The catch, you can only chat with people on the same level as you.
