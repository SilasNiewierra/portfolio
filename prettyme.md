  headline: About PrettyMe
  content: PrettyMe has a very simple concept. Two pictures, one winner. With a quick
    swipe you decide who is more handsome. You compete with your profile picture against
    other users. By winning matches, you gain points. Once you reach a certain amount
    of points, you get a new crown which indicates different levels. The catch, you
    can only chat with people on the same level as you.
