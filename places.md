  content: 'Places was born out of the idea to explore your neighborhood but with
    a specific goal. Imagine the following: "You just studied for 4 hours and would
    like to take a 60 min break. You would like to go outside to catch some fresh
    air but you’re not the type of person which just walks in a circle“. That’s where
    Places comes into the picture. You open the app and Places shows you beautiful
    spots in your area within an adjustable radius. Since you only have a 60 min Break,
    you look for a place within 20 min walking distance. You see a great place, select
    it and Places shows you the exact direction to go there. You walk to the spot,
    enjoy the view, take a picture and add it to the spots gallery. You give the place
    a like and you''re on your way back. Just in time to get back to work with a fresh
    mind.'
