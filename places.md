  content: Places was born out of the idea to explore your neighborhood but with a
    specific goal. Imagine the following "You just studied for 4 hours and would like
    to take a 60-min break. You would like to go outside to catch some fresh air but
    you’re not the type of person which just walks in a circle". That’s where <span
    class="hiddenGrammarError">Places</span> <span class="hiddenGrammarError">comes</span>
    into the picture. You open the app and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">Places</span>
    shows you beautiful spots in your area within an adjustable radius. Since you
    only have a 60-min Break, you look for a place within 20 min walking distance.
    You see a great place, select it and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">Places</span>
    shows you the exact direction to it. You walk to the spot, enjoy the view, take
    a picture and add it to the spots' gallery. After a 20-min rest you're on your
    way back, just in time to get back to work with a fresh mind.
