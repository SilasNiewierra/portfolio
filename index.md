  headline: <strong>About Me<span class="light"><br></span></strong><span class="light">just
    a few words to describe myself</span>
  content: Always positive and eager to learn. I guess those two are my most defining
    attributes. And which better to always be forced to keep on learning and improving
    than technology. I love to learn new coding languages, solve new and challenging
    problems and improve the world around me by doing my small part. Working in a
    very organized and structured way helps me to tackle problems which might seem
    too big at the beginning. But having the urge to accomplish more today than yesterday
    and being disciplined to solve every problem I'm facing, is the power engine which
    allows me to keep going.

  content: 'GymMeMore is your perfect companion for the gym. Allowing you to track
    your progress without any additional features enables you to concentrate on what''s
    important. You and your journey. In contrast to the current trend of putting more
    and more features in fitness tracking apps, GymMeMore is slimmed down to one simple
    core feature. Track your sets, weight, and reps. See your previous performances
    and keep on growing. You can follow pre created workout plans or create your own. '
