    a few words to describe myself</span>
  content: Always positive and eager to learn. I guess those two are my most defining
    attributes. And which better to always be forced to keep on learning and improving
    than technology. I love to learn new coding languages, solve new and challenging
    problems and improve the world around me by doing my small part. Working in a
    very organized and structured way helps me to tackle problems which might seem
    too big at the beginning. The urge to accomplish more today than yesterday, the
    discipline to keep going and commitment to solve every problem I'm facing, is
    the power engine which allows me to keep growing every day.<br><br>Some of my
    interests besides coding are:<br>Fitness ● Music Production ● Traveling ● Investments
    ● Real Estate

  content: Since I'm highly interested in various fields and technologies, I develop
    all sorts of applications. Either to improve the efficiency of a workout or to
    find beautiful spots in the nature, everything is possible. So please go ahead
    and have a closer look at some the projects I worked on.<br><br><a href="/projects"
