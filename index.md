  content: 'GymMeMore is your perfect companion for the gym. Allowing you to track
    your progress without any additional features enables you to concentrate on what''s
    important. You and your journey. In contrast to the current trend of putting more
    and more features in fitness tracking apps, GymMeMore is slimmed down to one simple
    core feature. Track your sets, weight, and reps. See your previous performances
    and keep on growing. You can follow pre created workout plans or create your own. '
