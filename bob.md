  headline: About BOB
  content: 'Travel through a dreamy world with a very chill atmosphere and collect
    as many diamonds as possible. There are just two controls: a single and a double
    tap. Tap once — jump once, tap twice — jump twice, that’s it. With the randomly
    generated levels it never gets boring trying to beat your own high score.'
