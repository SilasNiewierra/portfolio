  headline: About GymMeMore
  slug: ''
  content: '"Another one" that’s not just the catchphrase of a famous DJ, but it seems
    like this is also the idea behind most fitness apps when it comes to features.
    GymMeMore is a hard contrast to these feature-crowded workout and fitness apps.
    There is just one feature. Track your progress during your workout. No fancy calorie
    tracking, no setting goals, no sharing with everybody on this planet. Just YOU
    and your stats.'
